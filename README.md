# lenormand
Throwback project to the start of my web dev life. EJS / Handlebars / Bootstrap frontend, solidly MVC architecture, node app

`npm start` at the folder level to run the project. 

A more updated / emoji-based Lenormand app is live at [https://lenormand.vercel.app/](https://lenormand.vercel.app/)
